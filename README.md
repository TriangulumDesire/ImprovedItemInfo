# Improved Item Info.
Improved Item Info (III) is [tModLoader](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader) mod for Terraria that displays more comprehensive stats about weapons.  
It essentially shows how the weapon is affected by modifiers and accessories, as well as adding extra tooltips (such as projectile velocity).  
  
It is a spiritual successor to [ItemStats+](https://github.com/Xahlicem/XItemStats) (by Xahlicem) rewritten completely from scratch.  
  
This mod should work with all modded items, and it has cross-mod support with Clicker Class and Calamity. Thorium bard and healer support is planned.  

If you have anything you wish to contribute or want to fork this mod, you're more than welcome to.
