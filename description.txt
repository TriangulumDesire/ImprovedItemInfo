Improved Item Info (III) is mod that displays more comprehensive stats about weapons.
It essentially shows how the weapon is affected by modifiers and accessories, as well as adding extra tooltips (such as projectile velocity).

It is a spiritual successor to ItemStats+ (by Xahlicem) rewritten completely from scratch.

This mod should work with all modded items, and it has cross-mod support with Clicker Class and Calamity. Thorium bard and healer support is planned.

All tooltips that this mod affects are configurable.

Supported languages:
* English
* Chinese (Simplified)
* French
* German
* Russian

Translation credits:
